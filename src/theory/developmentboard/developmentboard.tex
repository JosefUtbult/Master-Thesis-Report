\subsection{Development board}

A \textit{development board}, or in short hand form a \textit{devboard}, is a PCB containing a microprocessor and 
pin headers for interfacing with the legs of the microprocessor IC. 
It also contains everything needed to run the microprocessor, such as voltage regulators and oscillator circuitry.
Many development boards also include on-board programming functionality, which lets you as a programmer program 
the board using only a USB connection to the development board.
