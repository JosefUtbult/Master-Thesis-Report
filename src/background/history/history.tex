The human-feline relationship has a long and storied history, dating back thousands of years. Cats, known for their independent nature and captivating personalities, have evolved alongside humans, seamlessly integrating themselves into our homes and hearts \cite{wiki:cat}. As cat owners, it is our responsibility to ensure their physical and emotional well-being, which includes providing them with appropriate and enriching environments.

Cats, as descendants of solitary hunters, have retained their instincts for seeking out secure and secluded spaces. These spaces serve as their retreats, offering solace and a sense of safety. Providing cats with suitable hiding spots not only respects their natural inclinations but also plays a crucial role in maintaining their overall health and contentment.
