The following is a description of the implementation and results of a set of
experiments run in order to implement the clock synchronisation functionality
defined by the USB Audio Class specification.

The code for these experiments, along with the results of the measurements, can
be found at the USB Audio Experimets repository made for this project
\cite{github:usbAudioExperiments}. These are grouped by tags, which refers to
the version of the code used during that particular experiment.
