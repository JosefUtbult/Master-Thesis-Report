I want to acknowledge the following people, who have helped me tremendously. 
Without their contributions, this report would never have been made.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Per Lindgren, who was my supervisor for this master thesis, and helped me to get on the right path.
	\item Emil Fresk, who functioned as my Rust-guru and helped me with problems I would have never have solved myself.
	\item The dude who made the usbd\_audio module for Rust. 
	\item XP-el
\end{itemize}
\todo{Expand on usbd\_audio}

I truly stand on the shoulders of giants.
